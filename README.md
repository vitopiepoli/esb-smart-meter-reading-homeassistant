# How to read your Smart Meter data automatically?
<br>
Thanks to the work from badger707 I used the code and trying to configure a custom component for Home Assistant for easy integration for other users.
Learning as I go....
<br><br>
# Requirements<br>
* You need to create account with ESB here https://myaccount.esbnetworks.ie <br>
* In your account, link your electricity meter MPRN
<br><br>
# Script setup<br>
* UI will pop up to input username, password, MPRN and scantime.

<br><br>
...
<br><br>
UPDATES: <br>
* 07-June-2024 -- work in progress, got the script to run in Home Assistant but created a sensor for each value. Updated the code to try repair that. Now working on the config_flow for the integration to load via the UI.
